Android NewbornNews Application

My wife was pregnant for the 3rd time.  I was looking for an Android project.  I realized that I needed something better than a spreadsheet to keep track of all that baby stuff - wet/dirty diapers, feedings, wife's meds, etc.  It was just a pain to open the computer at 3am to log the data. So, a mobile app was the perfect solution. There are a couple existing applications with similiar functionality, but this was a good reason to delve into Android.
